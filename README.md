*This my old project which I created in December 2021*

In that time I wanted to make something similar to actual Steam platform (but of course in beginner edition XD) as a practice. I took the first steps towards it, but never finished it.

In the near future I will try to finish and improve it. I plan to add simple database integration, dynamic downloads, user accounts, and other features that its older, full-fledged counterpart offers. In the future I might create it with some framework.
